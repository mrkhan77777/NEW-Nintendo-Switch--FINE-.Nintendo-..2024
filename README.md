Then thereâ€™s the Switch Lite, the cheapest Switch model, which has a 5.5-inch LCD screen and built-in controls. Itâ€™s smaller, cheaper, and made exclusively for portable use. You canâ€™t connect the Switch Lite to a TV, even if you buy a dock separately. It plays the same games just as well as the standard version, unless they need you to remove the Joy-ConsBut itâ€™s missing a vibration motor, and smaller in-game text can sometimes be harder to read on its smaller screen.

Finally, thereâ€™s the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, which has a beautiful OLED display. While the OLED Model is nearly identical in its dimensions to the base model, the bezel around the screen is much smaller, and the display itself is 7.0 inches. The screen is one of the best handheld displays weâ€™ve ever seen, with strong, deep blacks and great contrast, and good color reproduction. It also has louder, clearer speakers, a proper stand that works well, and its dock supports wired network connections. But those things command a higher price.
